..ID (display identifier stored in CADL, CPDL, etc)
LF = LCD/LVDS? (the laptop screen for sure)
CR = CRT
TV = TV
HD = HDMI
DV = DVI
DP = Display Port
These names are initially initialised at 0xFFFFFFFF but are set by GOID if a
device exists.

LCDM = 0x0808 laptop LCD screen
CRTM = 0x0101 CRT
TVOM = 0x0202 TV output
HDMM = 0x0404 HDMI
DVIM = 0x4040 DVI
DPOM = 0x8080 Display Port output


(methods below are in context of \_SB.PCI0.GFX0 unless indicated otherwise)

OA2D
Return device ID if Arg0 matches an existing device (..ID)

GOID Get Output ID?
Checks whether Arg0 indicates a CR, TV, LF or HD device. If so, it fills in the
..ID accordingly.

SOID Set Output IDs?
Calls GOID for all 8 items in the CPDL ("Currently Attached (or Present) Display
Devices List", 3.1.5 of OpRegion spec)

D2AF Device To Active F... ?
Depending on Arg0, a bit is enabled and returned. If Arg0 is LCDM, then the
first bit is set. The next bits are set when Arg0 equals CRTM, TVOM, DVIM, HDMM
or DPOM respectively. If there is no match, the value NXTD (Next Device?,
initially set at One = LCDM) is returned.

OGCA Output Get Current Active?
After this, the value of CPDL is checked. If this list is empty, store LCDM in
OCAD. Otherwise, save the device ID (..ID) of the last device in this list in
OCAD.

GCAD Get Current Active Display?
Calls OGCA and returns OCAD

ADVD
line 7812 TODO

GCDS
Calls OGCA and OGCD (not at boot because initially OEMF = 1) TODO
Returns D2AF(CSTE)

\GCDM calls GCDS if PRST() TODO

variable BRNC is initially Zero.
_DOS Disable Output Switching
If DRDY:
Store the first two bits in DOSF (see ACPI spec). Possibly values: 0 =
	do not automatically toggle active display output and generate display
	switch event. (and 1 to 3, but Linux does not use that). Initially OEMF
	= 1 which means BIOS should automatically toggle (switch) active display
	output without generating an event
Bit 3 is saved into BRNC. 0 = automatic brightness control by BIOS, 1 = BIOS
should not automatically change brightness.

UPBL Increase Brightness Level
If BRNC is set (if automatic brightness control):
if the current device (CSTE) is not LCD, return (i.e. do not change brightness)
If not BRNC, incremeant LBTN (brightness level) and call EC0.STBR

DWBL Decrease Brightness Level
If BRNC is set (if automatic brightness control):
if the current device (CSTE) is not LCD, return (i.e. do not change brightness)
If not BRNC, decremeant LBTN (brightness level) and call EC0.STBR

EC0.STBR Set Brightness
Write to a SMI port or calls GFX0.AINT if OS is not Linux.

As far as I can see, this is the sequence in the kernel:
video_detect: evaluate _DOD
i915: set DIDL (evaluate all GFX.*._ADR methods). The _ADR methods return an
	index number (1-8 for DD0#, special case: DD02 is named LCDD) if the
	DIDL item is zero. Otherwise DID# & 0xFFFF is returned.
video.c: _DOS(0)

If CADL is set, then:
OGCD sets CSTE to something other than LCDM

CADL is only used in CDDS and OGCD.

CDDS is only used in _DCS methods. _DCS is only called in ASL in two places in a
embedded controller query (possibly brightness hotkeys)

Possible conflict with drivers/platform/x86/asus-laptop.c?
